Rayverb, a raytracing impulse response generator built with Haskell.

//  TO DO

distance-based attenuation of impulses

materials defined as convolution kernels instead of reflective/diffuse values?
or maybe just as 3/5/7 band eq parameters?
or some other way of introducing frequency modification

specular components for materials

some kind of UI? Maybe?

xml parser for input

ambisonics

multiple attenuation coefficients for materials
eq/filter impulse response on output
