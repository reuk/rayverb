Rayverb, a raytracing impulse response generator built with Haskell.

//  TO DO

distance-based attenuation of impulses

materials defined as convolution kernels instead of reflective/diffuse values

    or some other way of introducing frequency modification

possibly specular components for materials if I don't do the convolution thing

some kind of UI? Maybe?
