Rayverb, a raytracing impulse response generator built with Haskell.

//  TO DO

distance-based attenuation of impulses

some kind of UI? Maybe?

input and output streaming parsers

cmd line parser

maybe turn into library with a couple of cmd line utilities that can be wrapped with C++ programs

research other methods of reflection and refraction in standard raytracing
    for example, brdf

at the moment each sample is 'snapped' to the closest time - could I do some kind of aliasing instead?
